Implement a simple PCA algorithm that reduces dimensionality by only 2 principal components, with python and numpy library only. Two arguments will be given in the commandline: input_filename, output_filename. Encode any categorical columns into integers. 
 
def simple_pca(input_filename: str, output_filename: str):
    """
    Performs a simple PCA to reduce dimensionality to 2 principal components.

    The input is a comma-separated matrix (CSV file) of size n x m.
    The output is a comma-separated matrix (CSV file) of size n x 2,
    representing the data projected onto the first two principal components.

    Args:
        input_filename (str): Path to the input CSV file (n x m matrix).
        output_filename (str): Path to the output CSV file (n x 2 matrix).
